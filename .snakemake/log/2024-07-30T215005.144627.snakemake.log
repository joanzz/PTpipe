MissingOutputException in rule sampleQC in file /gpfs/hpc/home/lijc/zhuzp/PTseeker/workflow/rules/baseQC.smk, line 15:
Job 6  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
data/02_qc2.irem
Removing output files of failed job sampleQC since they might be corrupted:
data/02_qc2.log, data/02_qc2.nosex, data/02_qc2.vcf, data/02_qc2.vcf.gz
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
