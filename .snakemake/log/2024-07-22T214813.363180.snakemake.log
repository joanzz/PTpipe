MissingOutputException in rule sampleQC in file /gpfs/hpc/home/lijc/zhuzp/PTseeker/workflow/rules/baseQC.smk, line 16:
Job 6  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
data/example.vcf_qc2.vcf
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
